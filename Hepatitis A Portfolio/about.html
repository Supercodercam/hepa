<p id="abot">About Us!</p>
<p id="paragraph">We are sophmores, apart of a program called SMASH x Wayne State. At thiss program we live on campus, and take STEM classes. We are in year 1 and our main focus project was to create somethin to basicaly control a part of the disease. We created Safe-Straw. Safe-Straw is a straw like filter that filters the hepatitis A virus. We are in the prototyping Stages of design at the moment. After viewing pictures of our prototype below, please provide feedback via our contact page so that we can improve our project.</p>

<p id="ep">Hepatitis A is contracted through contaminated water and food. We decided to target developinh countries that dont have a clean source of drinking water, since this is where hepatitis A affects the most. When we begin to sale our productts we will havea  buy one, give one. With this when a straw is bought, one is given to a family in need in a developing country.</p>
